# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I think I have done a good job managing my time by looking through my Mod 0 schedule fequently and updating my plans for each segment. Overall I think my time-management is a strength of mine, but there are definitely still things I want to work on.
I have easily lost track of time when completing assignments, and haven't kept track of how long assignments are taking. It would be really helpful for me to have a solid idea of how long each of my assignments are taking for planning and setting aside time for future assignments, and recognizing where I am staying on track with my schedule and where I am falling behind.


- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

Functions are recipes for your computer! They tell your computer the result or "food" they want to create, and give it each step to take to reach their final product.


- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

I think of the difference between arguments and parameters similarily to the difference between "=" and "==="

I think of a parameter as similar to the assignment operator "=" because it is an instruction for your computer within the function you are defining. When defining a function, you will define a certain number of values than can be passed through your function.


I think of arguments as the equality operator "===", because it is asking your computer a question. In order to invoke your function after it is defined, you will enter an amount of specific values to your code that you want your function to evaluate. These values are arguments.

In the following example:

```javascript

function addTwoNums(num1, num2)
var sum = num1 + num 2
console.log(sum)

```

"num1" and "num2" are parameters set in the "defining" stage of your function. They are telling your computer the number and format of values to expect passed as arguments when your function is called.

```javascript

console.log(addTwoNums(10,10))
```

In this line of code, "10" and "10" are arguments set in the "invoking" stage of your function. Once your function has been established, you can call the function to evaluate any two values as arguments.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

When I tried using strings as parameters, I kept getting an error. Vs code gave me a hint to put a "_" before a string parameter which gave me the output I was looking for, but I'm still confused what the underscore does in the code, and want to understand better how your computer interprets strings as parameters.
